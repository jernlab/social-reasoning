        A group of researchers have conducted a study to see how people with different relationships make choices that affect each other. The study involved pairs of people who were either friends, strangers, or enemies. They participated in a scenario where each person chooses one of two options (A or B). The two people get cash rewards that depend on the choices they both made. <b>The players are not allowed to communicate and make their decisions in private, but both people know the full table of payouts before making their choices.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, suppose the two players are Olivia and Todd. Here is one possible payout table.
    </p>
    <p>
    <table class="gameTable" border="1"><colgroup><col class="grey"><col class="red" span="2"><col class="blue"></colgroup><tbody><tr><th>Olivia's Choice</th><th>Todd's Choice</th><th>Reward for Olivia</th><th>Reward for Todd</th></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td><span style="color:#FF0000">A</span></td><td><span style="color:#FF0000">A</span></td><td>$12</td><td>$12</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFAA"><td><span style="color:#FF0000">A</span></td><td><span style="color:#0000FF">B</span></td><td>$12</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td><span style="color:#0000FF">B</span></td><td><span style="color:#FF0000">A</span></td><td>$0</td><td>$12</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><td><span style="color:#0000FF">B</span></td><td><span style="color:#0000FF">B</span></td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td></tr></tbody></table>
    
    </p>
    <p>
        In this table, if Olivia chooses option <span style="color:#FF0000">A</span> and Todd chooses option <span style="color:#0000FF">B</span>, Olivia receives $12 and Todd receives $0.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the following screens, you will see the choices that pairs of people made. Your task will be to judge how likely it is that the pairs were friends, strangers, or enemies.
